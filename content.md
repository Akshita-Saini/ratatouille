# Ratatouille

## About Ratatouille

We are focused on consumer well-being through a healthy and organic diet. More and more food is being prepared using insecticides and pesticides, making naturally grown produce scarce. We want to solve this problem by providing our customers both the option of getting healthy home-grown produce and products made from them. These are grown organically, completely without any chemicals to help you get the most of all food you eat. We even have a monthy subscription plan, where users can choose to receive the products of their choice every month.

We also offer the free services of a nutritionist who'll help you create a diet plan so you can have a balanced diet.
